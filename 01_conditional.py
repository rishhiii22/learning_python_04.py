# Conditional Statements in Python

# In python programming, we use conditional statements to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.

a = int(input("Enter your age:"))

# If-else ladder

if(a>=18):
    print("You are above the age of consent")
    print("You can vote")



else: 
    print("You are below the age of consent")

    print("You cannot vote")

print("Thank you for using this program")
